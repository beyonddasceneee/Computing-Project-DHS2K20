*STORY*



THE COLLECTOR


    It was a gloomy evening and I sighed, slouching against my bed. I had so much home work to be done, and furthermore, my WAs were looming over the horizon, like a gigantic monster, forever taunting me.I lived in the school hostel,away from my parents as my home was simply way too far from school and I just coudnt find much time to get my assignments done once I got home, or have some time with my family. My mom usually called just before 5, and I had just finished talking with her. I felt very lonely at first, but eventually I found accompanyment with my form teacher, Ms Lim, and one of my friends who was a foreign transfer student from India, Padma. Ms Lim usually came over, to check on how I was doing. I usually spent afternoons with Padma, studying together. 
    
     Then, I heard a knock on the door." come in!" I yelled, dragging myself off my bed. It was Padma. She came to have a revision session with me. On my way out, I glanced at the calendar. June 6th. Weird, I thought, that date seemed oddly familiar to me. But I just shruged it off and grabbed out my math textbook. Me and padma sat on the small couch, occassionally asking each other for clarifications along the way. Soon, it approached midnight. "Oh my, it so late!" Padma gasped as she looked at the clock. However, just as she collected her books and was ready to leave, Ms Lim came in through the front door. " What are you doing up so ;ateat night??" she demanded. We looked at each other and explained to her that we had just lost track of time and we would be asleep in a jiffy. 
     
    Just as I finished my sentence, the clock struck midnight, and three loud knocks sounded from the door. Instanly, the lights flickered. A cold feeling of dread washed over me out of nowhere. I saw Ms Lim's face visibly change into an expression of fear and shock. " stay away from the door." she said, her voice shaking. Padma looked quizzically over at her."But why? Isnt it pretty impolite?" she asked as she paced towards the door. "NO!"Ms lim shoted, trying to get her away from the door. But it was all too late. She turned the handle, and the door creaked open.
    
   
   In the doorway, stood a man.  No, not a man. It was a vaguely humanoid figure, with no hair on its withered head. Its body was wrapped in garments and shreds of clothes, with mis,atched limbs. Its left arm was missig, with a muscular and large right arm . It stood on mismathed legs, both obviously human, different in colour and size. On its head, there was no face, only a single, bloodshot eye. It had no mouth, no nose, and one ear. On its swelled hands were fingers. Human fingers, several of them. Some attached carelessly and randomly. In its right hand it help a sharp sewing needle that glinted in the darkness, partially coated in dark, red blood. A disgusting odor crept into my nostrils as I screamed in horror. " THE COLLECTOR!" Ms Lim yelled, as she ushered us away from the door. Padma jumped back in shock and fell iver onto the floor, scuttling away from the creature. Ms Lim explained that every one year, the collector would come, and take a body part from those who misbehaved or once did wrong. Every June the sixth. Ms Lim grabbed our hands and we ran into the toilet where we locked ourselves in the stall. "How do you know this??" I whisper-shouted at ms lim. We crouched in the stall, huddled together in a group. Padma was trembling, barely able to speak. "My  old friend. He used to always stamp on insects on purpose with his foot." I gasped, recaling the swelling, rotting foot attached to one of its mistmatched legs. Just then, the door crashed open and a slow clicking noise rattled through the toilet. It saw us. Its one bloodshot eye bored into me as it stared through the gap of the stall. With a long, slender arm, It reached over the top of the stall, reaching for us with its gnarled fingers. " its all my fault." i gasped, as I dodged the wildly grasping arm of the collector. I had always promised to help out everyone around me, getting into tons of promises, and projects, even though I knew I woudnt be able to cope. Over time, they piled up, and many started to get agitated that I was not fulfilling what I had promised. Me and my big mouth. I knew what it was coming for now. 
   
  "In here!" Ms Lims voiced snapped me out of my thoughts. There was an open air vent swinging about above us. She hoiseted me into the air vent, and Padma. "Hide!You MUST hide until sunrise!" Padma and I crawled through the dark and cramped air vents as Ms Lim stayed in the toilet. We crawled and crawled, and I eventually lost my bearing of time. Is it sunrise yet? I asked Padma, sitting down to take a break. 
  Suddenly, the vent in front of us shot open as a long, decaying arm shot out from the vent and into the air ducts. The collector had found us! Padma screamed and went barreling in the other direction. I tried to follow suit, but it grabbed onto my shirt, with an iron grip.I kicked and twsited, but to no avail.As one of its arms held me in place, the other came in front of me and grabbed onto y mouth. The long, sharp fingernails tightened around my lips. I felt skin tearing and tasted the metallic taste of blood on my tongue. The last thing I saw was Padma creeping away, and the roof of the air duct as I blacked out.
  
  When I awoke, I was lying in a hospital bed, with thick bandages wrapped around my jaw. Padma and Ms Lim stood over me, a concerned look on their faces. "Well, the collector didnt manage to get you eNtiRe mouth off..." Padma said. " Ms Lim distracted it long enough so it became dawn before it could do so. She called the cops and I pushed you out of the air duct." I grabbed my bandages and started to pull. I took a nearby mirror and looked at my face. I saw long stitch marks around my lips, holding my mouth together. That day, I decided never to ever get into commitments i  coudnt fulfil.
  
  I guess i'll be safe. For another year.
